# Universal Calculator Page Master Prompt

## 1. Purpose of this template
This template is designed to maintain functional and visual consistency across a suite of calculator pages for any web project, ensuring that every tool feels like part of a unified ecosystem while allowing for diverse technical logic.

## 2. Design and product principles
Every calculator must adhere to these core principles: a practical and professional tone, transparent logic through visible assumptions, a mobile-first responsive layout, and ensuring the tool is usable immediately above the fold.

## 3. Shared page structure
Standard pages should include: a Hero section with H1 and brief description, the functional Calculator Module, a Results hierarchy, a Logic/Formulas section, an FAQ, and a Disclaimer footer.

## 4. Shared UI/UX rules
Input fields should utilize appropriate controls (sliders, dropdowns, toggles) on the left/top, with real-time results displayed prominently on the right/bottom using contrasting visual anchors for primary outputs.

## 5. Shared accessibility rules
All calculators must meet WCAG standards, including proper ARIA labels for dynamic results, keyboard navigability for all controls, and high color contrast for readability.

## 6. Shared mobile rules
The interface must collapse into a single-column stack on small screens, ensuring touch targets are appropriately sized and inputs do not trigger obstructive zoom behaviors.

## 7. Shared repository safety rules
Coding agents must not introduce third-party dependencies outside of the approved stack, must not alter global stylesheets, and should strictly follow the PIV (Plan-Implement-Validate) workflow.

## 8. Parameter list
Before using the template, define: `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{CALCULATOR_NAME}}`, `{{INDUSTRY_CATEGORY}}`, `{{PRIMARY_USER_GOAL}}`, `{{INPUT_FIELDS}}`, `{{OUTPUT_FIELDS}}`, `{{FORMULA_LOGIC}}`, `{{FAQ_TOPICS}}`, and `{{RELATED_TOOLS}}`.

## 9. Reusable master prompt template
"I am implementing a new `{{CALCULATOR_NAME}}` for the `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` platform within the `{{INDUSTRY_CATEGORY}}` category. Please build a complete page where the primary goal is `{{PRIMARY_USER_GOAL}}`. Use the following inputs: `{{INPUT_FIELDS}}` and provide these outputs: `{{OUTPUT_FIELDS}}` based on `{{FORMULA_LOGIC}}`. Ensure the UI follows the two-column layout and established mobile behaviors. Include sections for `{{FAQ_TOPICS}}` and link to `{{RELATED_TOOLS}}`."

## 10. Usage instructions
To use this template, replace all double-bracketed variables with specific project data and provide it to the coding agent alongside the shared design system documentation.

## 11. Consistency checklist
- Is the calculator visible above the fold?
- Are results updating in real-time?
- Does the mobile view stack correctly?
- Are the technical assumptions clearly stated?
- Is the brand tone preserved?
